Functions:
	1. Create and initialize car agents
	2. Create and initialize Station Agent(s)
	3. Link all agents in a link list (car_list)
	4. Simulation (loop till all cars are parked)
		a. Broadcast (Car: Destination and Time; Station: availabilities)
		b. Compute Destinations
		c. Update Destination and Time; Update Station availabilities
		d. Output Result(s)
	5. Output Final Result
